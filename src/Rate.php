     * The following example shows the <Refundable> element with all of its

     *   <Refundable available="1" refundable_until_days="7" refundable_until_time="18:00:00"/>

     * message is generated when one or more attributes are not set.

     * If you do not set any attributes, the rate does not display as
     * refundable. The attributes are:
     *
     *  * available: (Required) Set to 1 or true to indicate if the rate allows
     *    a full refund; otherwise set to 0 or false.
     *  * refundable_until_days: (Required if available is true) Specifies the
     *    number of days in advance of check-in that a full refund can be
     *    requested. The value of refundable_until_days must be an integer
     *    between 0 and 330, inclusive.
     *  * refundable_until_time: (Highly recommended if available is true)
     *    Specifies the latest time of day, in the local time of the hotel, that
     *    a full refund request will be honored. This can be combined with
     *    refundable_until_days to specify, for example, that "refunds are
     *    available until 4:00PM two days before check-in". If
     *    refundable_until_time isn't set, the value defaults to midnight.
     *
     *    The value of this attribute uses the Time format.
     *
     * When setting the attributes, note the following:
     *
     *  * If available or refundable_until_days isn't set, the rate does not
     *    display as refundable.
     *  * If available is 0 or false, the other attributes are ignored. The rate
     *    does not display as refundable even if one or both of the other
     *    attributes is set.

     *   the type of guests (adults or children). Refer to <OccupancyDetails>
     *   for syntax and description of child elements.
     * * If you specify <Occupancy> in both <RoomBundle> and <PackageData>, the

     *   the number of people that the room can physically accommodate.
     * * Partners must be whitelisted by Google to be able to send
     *   non-double occupancy prices. Contact your support team to enable this
